I don\'t suppose they had ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne and Cook\'s, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud\'s. They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a bath-room with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and a good deal of white paint, and \'every modern convenience\', as the house-agents say.\n\nThere were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course, Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD had a favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.\n\nMother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her. She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons. Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the christening of the new kittens, or the refurnishing of the doll\'s house, or the time when they were getting over the mumps.\n\nThese three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was called James, and who was their very own. They also had a Father who was just perfect—never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game—at least, if at any time he was NOT ready, he always had an excellent reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and funnily that they felt sure he couldn\'t help himself. ','frankie','2023-02-25','Tech news',0),(4,'Third post',' Father had been away in the country for three or four days. All Peter\'s hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers. He could mend all sorts of things. He had often acted as veterinary surgeon to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its life when all human aid was despaired of, and the poor creature was given up for lost, and even the carpenter said he didn\'t see his way to do anything. And it was Father who mended the doll\'s cradle when no one else could; and with a little glue and some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah\'s Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were, if not stronger.\n\nPeter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his Engine till after Father had had his dinner and his after-dinner cigar. The unselfishness was Mother\'s idea—but it was Peter who carried it out. And needed a good deal of patience, too.\n\nAt last Mother said to Father, “Now, dear, if you\'re quite rested, and quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great railway accident, and ask your advice.”\n\n“All right,” said Father, “fire away!”\n\nSo then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what was left of the Engine.\n\n“Hum,” said Father, when he had looked the Engine over very carefully.\n\nThe children held their breaths. ','frankie','2023-02-25','Hardware reviews',0),(5,'The Railway Children.','“What fun!” said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on the table. “How frightened the poor mice were—I don\'t believe they were rats at all.”\n\nShe struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each other by its winky, blinky light.\n\n“Well,” she said, “you\'ve often wanted something to happen and now it has. This is quite an adventure, isn\'t it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I suppose she\'s laid it in the dining-room. So let\'s go and see.”\n\nThe dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker than the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the kitchen was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from floor to ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was a muddled maze of dusty furniture—the breakfast-room furniture from the old home where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a very long time ago, and a very long way off.\n\nThere was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there was no supper.\n\n“Let\'s look in the other rooms,” said Mother; and they looked. And in each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement of furniture, and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd things on the floor, but there was nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only a rusty cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it.\n\n“What a horrid old woman!” said Mother; “she\'s just walked off with the money and not got us anything to eat at all.”\n\n“Then shan\'t we have any supper at all?” asked Phyllis, dismayed, stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked responsively.\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Mother, “only it\'ll mean unpacking one of those big cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you\'re walking to, there\'s a dear. Peter, hold the light.”\n\nThe cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five wooden steps leading down. It wasn\'t a proper cellar at all, the children thought, because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen\'s. A bacon-rack hung under its ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the big cases.','Tom','2023-02-27','Opinion pieces',0),(6,'First Train','“There\'s the house,” said Mother. “I wonder why she\'s shut the shutters.”\n\n“Who\'s SHE?” asked Roberta.\n\n“The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight and get supper.”\n\nThere was a low wall, and trees inside.\n\n“That\'s the garden,” said Mother.\n\n“It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,” said Peter.\n\nThe cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back of the house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at the back door.\n\nThere was no light in any of the windows.\n\nEveryone hammered at the door, but no one came.\n\nThe man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs. Viney had gone home.\n\n“You see your train was that late,” said he.\n\n“But she\'s got the key,” said Mother. “What are we to do?”\n\n“Oh, she\'ll have left that under the doorstep,” said the cart man; “folks do hereabouts.” He took the lantern off his cart and stooped.\n\n“Ay, here it is, right enough,” he said.\n\nHe unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table.\n\n“Got e\'er a candle?” said he.\n\n“I don\'t know where anything is.” Mother spoke rather less cheerfully than usual.','frankie','2023-02-27','Software reviews',0),(7,'Peter\'s coal-mine.','Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.\n\n“It\'s very cold for May,” she said, feeling what a grown-up thing it was to say.\n\nThe fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look very different, for now you could see that the dark walls were of wood, carved here and there into little wreaths and loops.\n\nThe girls hastily \'tidied\' the room, which meant putting the chairs against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that Father used to sit in after dinner.\n\n“Bravo!” cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things. “This is something like! I\'ll just get a tablecloth and then—”\n\nThe tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened with a key and not with a shovel, and when the cloth was spread on the table, a real feast was laid out on it.\n\nEveryone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the sight of the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the Marie and the plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking raisins, and candied peel and marmalade.\n\n“What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the Store cupboard,” said Mother. “Now, Phil, DON\'T put the marmalade spoon in among the sardines.”\n\n“No, I won\'t, Mother,” said Phyllis, and put it down among the Marie biscuits.\n\n“Let\'s drink Aunt Emma\'s health,” said Roberta, suddenly; “what should we have done if she hadn\'t packed up these things? Here\'s to Aunt Emma!”\n\nAnd the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water, out of willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn\'t be found.\n\nThey all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma. She wasn\'t a nice cuddly person like Mother, but after all it was she who had thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to eat.\n\nIt was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and the men who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together, so the beds were soon made.\n\n“Good night, chickies,” said Mother. “I\'m sure there aren\'t any rats. But I\'ll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you need only scream, and I\'ll come and tell it exactly what I think of it.”\n\nThen she went to her own room. Roberta woke to hear the little travelling clock chime two. It sounded like a church clock ever so far away, she always thought. And she heard, too, Mother still moving about in her room.\n\nNext morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently, but quite enough for her purpose.\n\n“Wassermarrer?” asked Phyllis, still almost wholly asleep.','Tom','2023-02-27','Tech news',0),(8,'make a large pigeon-pie.','It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them—any game they liked—and of course their first choice was blindman\'s-buff, in the course of which Bobbie\'s forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.\n\n“You won\'t sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.\n\nAnd Mother said no, she wouldn\'t—she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.\n\nBut when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents—for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night—Mother was not writing, but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. I think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn\'t want me to know she\'s unhappy, and I won\'t know; I won\'t know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.','Tom','2023-02-27','Opinion pieces',0),(9,'The old gentleman.','A good many people did look out at the station and were disappointed, for they saw nothing unusual. The old gentleman looked out, too, and at first he too saw nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and the sunshine and the wallflowers and forget-me-nots in the station borders. It was only just as the train was beginning to puff and pull itself together to start again that he saw Phyllis. She was quite out of breath with running.\n\n“Oh,” she said, “I thought I\'d missed you. My bootlaces would keep coming down and I fell over them twice. Here, take it.”\n\nShe thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as the train moved.\n\nHe leaned back in his corner and opened the letter. This is what he read:—\n\n“Dear Mr. We do not know your name.\n\nMother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the end of the letter, but she says she can\'t aford it, and to get mutton for us and she will have the broth. We do not know anybody here but you, because Father is away and we do not know the address. Father will pay you, or if he has lost all his money, or anything, Peter will pay you when he is a man. We promise it on our honer. I.O.U. for all the things Mother wants.','Mary','2023-02-27','Opinion pieces',0),(10,'The engine-burglar.','The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to get Peter\'s engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came the very next afternoon.\n\nMother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping. When she went there, she always went to the Post-office. Perhaps to post her letters to Father, for she never gave them to the children or Mrs. Viney to post, and she never went to the village herself. Peter and Phyllis went with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go, but try as she would she couldn\'t think of a good one. And just when she felt that all was lost, her frock caught on a big nail by the kitchen door and there was a great criss-cross tear all along the front of the skirt. I assure you this was really an accident. So the others pitied her and went without her, for there was no time for her to change, because they were rather late already and had to hurry to the station to catch the train.\n\nWhen they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock, and went down to the railway. She did not go into the station, but she went along the line to the end of the platform where the engine is when the down train is alongside the platform—the place where there are a water tank and a long, limp, leather hose, like an elephant\'s trunk. She hid behind a bush on the other side of the railway. She had the toy engine done up in brown paper, and she waited patiently with it under her arm.\n\nThen when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie went across the metals of the up-line and stood beside the engine. She had never been so close to an engine before. It looked much larger and harder than she had expected, and it made her feel very small indeed, and, somehow, very soft—as if she could very, very easily be hurt rather badly.','Mary','2023-02-27','Software reviews',0),(11,'It\'s rather hard, you see,','When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently. But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling.\n\nPhyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. There was only just time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow before a little bell rang.\n\n“There!” said Phyllis, “that\'s to show the surprise is ready. Now you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the dining-room.”\n\nSo Bobbie waited.\n\n“Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she found herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers and singing. Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the table, one for each of Roberta\'s years. The table was covered with a sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta\'s place was a thick wreath of forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother and Phyllis and Peter were singing—to the first part of the tune of St. Patrick\'s Day. Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose for her birthday. It was a little way of Mother\'s on birthdays. It had begun on Bobbie\'s fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie remembered learning the verses to say to Father \'for a surprise.\' She wondered if Mother had remembered, too.

In this post, we\'ll provide some tips on how to choose the right gaming laptop for your needs.\n\n## Consider the Hardware\n\nThe hardware specifications of the laptop are the most important factor in determining gaming performance. Here are some guidelines for what to look for in each category:\n\n- CPU: A quad-core processor with a clock speed of at least 2.6 GHz is recommended for most games.\n\n- GPU: Look for a dedicated graphics card with at least 4GB of VRAM. NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon are popular choices.\n- RAM: 8GB is the minimum recommended amount for gaming, but 16GB is ideal.\n- Storage: A solid-state drive (SSD) is recommended for faster load times, but a traditional hard drive can be used for mass storage.\n\n## Consider the Cooling System\n\nGaming laptops can get hot under heavy load, so it\'s important to choose a laptop with a good cooling system. Look for laptops with multiple fans, large heat sinks, and good ventilation.\n\n## Consider Other Factors\n\nOther factors to consider when choosing a gaming laptop include:\n\n- Battery life: Gaming laptops tend to have short battery lives, so consider a laptop with a larger battery or an additional battery option.\n\n- Screen size and resolution: A larger screen and higher resolution will provide a better gaming experience, but will also increase the weight and cost of the laptop.\n\n- Keyboard and trackpad quality: A good keyboard and trackpad are essential for comfortable gaming sessions.\n\n## Consider Price\n\nGaming laptops can be expensive, but there are options available at different price points. Consider what you\'re willing to spend and look for laptops that fit within your budget.\n\n## Consider Building a Desktop PC\n\nIf you\'re on a tight budget, consider building a desktop PC instead of buying a gaming laptop. Desktops are generally more affordable and easier to upgrade.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can choose the right gaming laptop for your needs and get the most out of your gaming experience.\n','chatGPT','2023-02-28','Opinion pieces',0),(16,'Understanding Blockchain Technology: Applications and Benefits','## What is Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner.
